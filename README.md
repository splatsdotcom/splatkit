## Getting Started
Splatkit enables the creation and sharing of dynamic gaussian splats by providing a powerful and easy-to-use toolset. Splatkit leverages the latest techniques from the research community.
* Visit our [Learn Splatkit](http://splatkit.org/learn) course to get started with Splatkit.
* Visit the [Splatkit Showcase](http://splatkit.org/showcase) to see what others have built with Splatkit
